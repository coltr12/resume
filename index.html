        <p><em>Software Engineering Student</em></p>
        <p>Although I graduated in civil engineering,
          my favorite class during my college career was
          introduction to computer science. I currently work
          as a mechanical engineer for a heat treating company,
          however I am hoping to teach myself the necessary
          skills and knowledge to acquire my first job as a
          full stack developer.</p>
